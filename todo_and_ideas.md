# ToDo (Priorities)

- rejoin game (frontend)
- handle end of game (backend & frontend), if game is over

# Ideas

- REFACTOR: Utils Class in backend
- REFACTOR: Put logic from game manage into more different files

- Handle Death Function (especially Hunter)
- Allowing multiple seers, red ladys etc. (currenlty only villagers and werewolves are allowed multiple times)

- Settings: Either reveal player roles when they are dead or not

- See death history (who died when in which round)

### Frontend

- Animation between Phases
  - Slow animation revealing character
  - Starting animation in first night
- Sounds (frontend): The game master plays the theme (music) and all devices play random sounds (audio streaming)
- Frontend: Having action timer (max time 120 seconds or something)
- LobbyView: Scrolling Village Population 
- WerewolfView: Should be able to see which player the other wolf voted on (and give warning if other player votes differntly or if there could be a tie)
