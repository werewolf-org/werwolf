# Narrator Scripts

## Game Start
"Welcome to the village. A dark shadow has fallen over us. Among you, some are not what they seem. By day, we are a peaceful community, but by night, the werewolves strike. Trust no one, and may your intuition guide you to survival."

## Night Sequence

- **Start of Night:** "The sun dips below the horizon, and a chill wind sweeps through the cobblestone streets. Everyone, close your eyes and retreat into the safety of your dreams... if you can."
- **Cupid (First Night only):** "Cupid, open your eyes. In a world of teeth and shadows, find two hearts to bind together. Choose two souls whose fates shall be entwined until death do them part."
- **Red Lady:** "Red Lady, the night calls to you. Who shall receive your company tonight? Choose a house to visit, but beware—your safety depends entirely on the strength of your host."
- **Werewolves:** "The moon reaches its zenith, and the hunger becomes unbearable. Werewolves, open your eyes. Gaze upon your pack, sniff out the weak, and silently point to the one whose blood will stain the snow tonight."
- **Seer:** "Ancient spirits whisper in the dark. Seer, open your eyes. Peer through the veil of deception and choose one soul. I shall reveal if they carry the mark of the beast or the heart of a villager."
- **Witch:** "Bubbling cauldrons and secret vials... Witch, wake up. The wolves have left a trail of blood—look upon their victim. Will you use your elixir of life to mend them, or your brew of death to claim another? The choice is yours."

## Day Sequence

- **Start of Day:** "The morning fog clears as the village slowly awakens. Some breathe a sigh of relief, while others find only silence where a neighbor once stood. Let us gather in the town square and uncover the truth of this night."
- **Lynch Vote:** "The village must now decide who to send to the gallows. Discuss and cast your votes!"
- **End of Day:** "The verdict has been reached and the sentence carried out. As the sun begins to set, a heavy silence returns. Retreat to your homes and lock your doors; the shadows are lengthening once again."
