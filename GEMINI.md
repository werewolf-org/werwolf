This is a web app for the Werwolf Game.

Werewolf is a social deduction game where a informed minority of "werewolves" secretively eliminates players while an uninformed majority of "villagers" attempts to identify and vote them out.
In this mobile version of the game, people can join a game. They then get their roles and then play the game. During the Night special roles do special actions and during the night the village can vote who to vote out and lynch.

# Structure

There is the frontend (`frontend/`), the backend (`backend/`), and shared logic (`shared/`).
Both are written with typescript.

# Shared Logic (`shared/`)

The `shared/` folder contains code that is used by both the frontend and the backend. This ensures type safety and consistency across the entire application.

- **`roles.ts`**: Contains the `Role` enum, `RoleDef` interface, and the `ROLES` constant which defines the metadata (names, descriptions, teams, night order) for every role in the game.
- **`phases.ts`**: Contains the enum `Phase`.

# Reactive State Architecture

The project follows a **Reactive State Machine** pattern. In this model, the Frontend UI is a "pure function" of the State. 

### Core Mandates:
1.  **State-Driven UI**: UI elements MUST NOT trigger other UI elements directly. All UI changes must be a side-effect of a state update. (e.g., A button click calls a socket action -> Socket updates the Store -> Store triggers a UI re-render).
2.  **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Backend State -> Socket `syncState` -> Frontend Store -> UI.
3.  **Tailored Snapshots**: Instead of granular events, the backend sends a "Tailored State Snapshot" (`syncState`) to each player. This snapshot contains only the information that specific player is allowed to see (e.g., their own role, their own potion status, and public game info).

# Development Setup

- **Backend Port:** 3000
- **Frontend Port:** 5173
- **Environment:** Backend uses `.env` for configuration (e.g., `ORIGIN` for CORS).
- **Module System:** Backend is configured as ESM (`"type": "module"`).

# Backend Architecture

The backend is a pure **Node.js `http` + `socket.io`** application. **No Express is used.**
No database is used; all games are stored in-memory.

## Core Components (`backend/src/`)

### 1. Communication & Sync (`socket.service.ts`)
- **`syncState`**: The primary method for updating clients. It sends a partial `AppState` object tailored to the receiving player.
- **`broadcastSyncState`**: Iterates through all players in a game and sends each their own tailored `syncState`. This is called whenever any game-wide change occurs (phase change, vote cast, etc.).

### 2. Business Logic (`logic/`)
- **`game.manager.ts`**: The central orchestrator. 
    - Manages Game State (Lobby -> Setup -> Night -> Day).
    - Handles player joins/rejoins. **Rejoining is handled by updating the player's socketId and sending a fresh `syncState`.**
- **`role.handler.ts`**: Contains specific logic for each role. Actions here update the `Game` and `Player` objects, which are then synced to clients.

### 3. Data Storage (`store/`)
- **`game.store.ts`**: Singleton in-memory database (`Map<string, Game>`).

## Data Models
- **Enums:** String Enums are used for `Role` (e.g., `"WEREWOLF"`) and `Phase` (e.g., `"NIGHT"`) for better logging and serialization.
- **Player State:** Role-specific attributes (like `usedHealingPotion` or `lovePartner`) are stored in `Player` objects to persist across rounds and enable rejoining.

## Game Logic (State Machine)
The game follows a strict phase sequence:
1.  **LOBBY**: Players join via QR code/Socket.
2.  **SETUP**: Game Master selects roles.
3.  **DISTRIBUTION**: Roles are assigned.
4.  **NIGHT**: A sequence of sub-turns (Seer -> Wolves -> Witch -> ...).
    - The `Game` object tracks `activeNightRole` to know whose turn it is.
    - `role.handler.ts` manages the transition between roles using `nextRole`.
5.  **DAY**: Discussion and Voting.
    - Voting logic is handled in `GameManager.vote`.
    - Lynch resolution triggers a return to **NIGHT**.
6.  **GAME_OVER**: Win condition met.

# Frontend Architecture

## Core Concepts

The frontend is built without a heavy framework (like React or Vue), relying on a custom, lightweight component system.

### 1. The Reactive Store (`src/store.ts`)
- A centralized, observable store (`LocalAppState`).
- Views subscribe to specific parts of the state via `subscribeSelector`.
- **UI is reactive**: When the store receives a `syncState` from the server, all mounted views automatically update to reflect the truth.

### 2. View Architecture
- **Base Class**: All views extend the `View` abstract class (`src/base-view.ts`).
- **Lifecycle**:
    - `mount(container)`: Called when the view enters the DOM.
    - `unmount()`: Called when the view is replaced. It automatically cleans up all store subscriptions.
- **Subscription Management**: Views use `this.unsubs.push(subscribeSelector(...))` to track listeners. This prevents "ghost" updates from old rounds or destroyed components by ensuring all listeners are killed during `unmount()`.
- **Self-Updating**: Views are reactive. They mount once and listen to the store, mapping the current state to HTML whenever a relevant change occurs.

### 3. Routing (`src/router.ts`)
- A simple Hash-based router (`#/`, `#/game/:id`).
- Handles the lifecycle of top-level views.

### 4. Audio Service (`src/audio.service.ts`)
- A singleton managing atmosphere (looping background) and narration (one-time lines).
- **Narration is restricted**: To prevent chaos, narration sounds only play on the **Game Manager's** device.
- **Atmosphere**: Also restricted to the Game Manager to maintain a shared environmental feel for those playing in person.

## Folder Structure (`frontend/src/`)
- **`router.ts`**: Navigation logic.
- **`base-view.ts`**: The abstract `View` class and lifecycle definitions.
- **`store.ts`**: Global state.
- **`socket.service.ts`**: WebSocket communication.
- **`audio.service.ts`**: Sound and narration management.
- **`pages/`**:
    - **`start.ts`**: Landing page.
    - **`game.ts`**: Main Game Controller.
    - **`phases/`**: Sub-views for specific game phases.
